# Firebase

## About

- Firebase is Google's Database.
- It has 2 database types:
  - NoSQL i.e. Firestore DB
  - SQL i.e. Realtime DB

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Incorrect Data structure

- _Cause_: It doesn't support the data structure you are trying to store.
- _Solution_: Use the correct data structure as Firebase considers all collection to be an array.

**Before**:

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "emails": ["vinny@upside.gg", "abhijit@upside.gg", "alejandro@upside.gg"]
  }
}
```

**After**:

```json
{
  "authorization": [
    {
      "emails": ["vinny@upside.gg", "abhijit@upside.gg", "alejandro@upside.gg"]
    }
  ]
}
```
